Day 8 Learn Ethical Hacking 

topic- Wireshark Basics (Packet Capture and Analysis)


Wireshark captures the data coming or going through the NICs on its device by using an underlying packet capture library. By default, Wireshark captures on-device data only, but it can capture almost all the data on its LAN if run in promiscuous mode.3

All tools and scripts are already installed in Kali Linux and Parrot OS.
