Day -2 Learn Ethical Hacking 

Topic - Networking Fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, Subnetting)

1. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):

Purpose: TCP/IP is the foundation of the Internet. It defines how data should be formatted, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received.

2. DNS (Domain Name System):

Purpose: DNS translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1) so that computers can locate each other on the Internet.

3. Subnetting:

Purpose: Subnetting is a technique used to divide an IP network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks (subnets).
